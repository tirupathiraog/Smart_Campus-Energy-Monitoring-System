# 📌 Overview

The **Smart Campus Energy Monitoring System** is a web-based application developed to monitor, analyze, and visualize electricity consumption across multiple campus buildings in real time.

The system continuously collects energy readings, detects abnormal power consumption using threshold-based anomaly detection, stores historical data in PostgreSQL, and presents actionable insights through a modern interactive dashboard.

The primary objective of this project is to promote efficient energy management by providing administrators with live monitoring, analytical reports, and instant alerts whenever unusual energy usage is detected.
